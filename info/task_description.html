    But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for this games results. You are given a result of a
    game and you must determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be the winner. Make sure to
    return <b>"X"</b>
    if the X-player wins and <b>"O"</b> if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return <b>"D"</b>.
